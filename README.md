# llvm.vim

This repository mirrors the upstream vim syntax configuration files from
[`llvm/llvm-project`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) in order to
make installing and updating more ergonomic.

## Installation

package support:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/llvm/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/llvm/start
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm.vim.git
```

## Contributing

If you would like to improve these syntax files, please submit a pull
request to the upstream
[`llvm/llvm-project`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) repo. The
changes are synced to this repository daily.
